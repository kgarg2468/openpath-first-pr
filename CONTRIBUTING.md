## Branching and commits

- Use a short branch name like `add-your-name`.
- Keep your commit message simple, such as "Add my name".
- Only include one line change in `participants.md`.

## What reviewers look for

- You followed the one-PR rule.
- You added only one line in the correct format.
- You did not include private or sensitive information.

## Learning from feedback

If a reviewer requests changes, update your branch and push again. Feedback is normal in open-source projects and helps you grow as a contributor.
